# Machine-Learning-Series'


#### This Series is all about machine learning even you have already know, worked on it ore starter... i felt i need to redo the learning and making model to learn by what i give...  
#### so it's my learning path to bring some knowlegde and prospective towrds ml models.
==========================================================================================  
  
we all know **AI** is Whole Universe it mimics the humans in order to make decision and solve problems faster that humans. they interpret and under goes comprehensive learning to make precise decisions, AI Could be a ROBOT/TOOLS/Machine.....   
  
**ML** Which Learns the pattern from the data we give it to learn from that, data has input and output, where ml learns the data and its pattern between input and output, once learned it builds the model that suits its data type, then it predicts, decide or solves the problems.

  Based on what i just understood that ml ---> takes data ----> learns from it -----> builds model ----> answers the questions  
  So Here is how it happens
  **Episode 1: How ML Learns and Prdicts** [Link](how_ml_works.ipynb)  
  **Episode 2: How to Build Brain (Neural Networks)** [Link](how_to_build_brain.md)
